This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

This is a Cost Breakdown Calculator.
The application uses Ember and multiple helpers to display the user the average price based on the users input.
Then it is determined how much each person owes, depending on how much they have already paid.

As extra credit, instead of having a Tally Up button, the final list is updated automatically.
