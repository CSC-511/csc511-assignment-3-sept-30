# Assignment-3

This application was developed to add participants and split the cost between each user
each participant can add a spending event which they are allowed to have as many as they
would like.

For each name or spending event added the total is shown for the total spent and how much
each participant had paid and owes to the group.

If any participants are deleted their events are automatically removed and the calculations 
are redone to reflect to updated results.
